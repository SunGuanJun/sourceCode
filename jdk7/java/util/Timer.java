/**
 * A facility for threads to schedule tasks for future execution in a
 * background thread.  Tasks may be scheduled for one-time execution, or for
 * repeated execution at regular intervals.
 * 一个在后台进程中的设备，它可以给其他线程安排在未来执行的任务。
 * 任务可以被安排成一次执行，也可以被设置成固定间隔重复执行
 *
 * <p>Corresponding to each <tt>Timer</tt> object is a single background
 * thread that is used to execute all of the timer's tasks, sequentially.
 * Timer tasks should complete quickly.  If a timer task takes excessive time
 * to complete, it "hogs" the timer's task execution thread.  This can, in
 * turn, delay the execution of subsequent tasks, which may "bunch up" and
 * execute in rapid succession when (and if) the offending task finally
 * completes.
 * 与每个Timer对象对应的是一个用来顺序执行所有计时任务的后台线程。
 * Timer任务必须快速完成。如果一个Timer任务花费了过多的时间，那么它可能会“压垮”这个线程。
 * 这样可能会拖延后续任务的执行，让他们“缩成一团”  （快速执行？）
 * 
 *
 * <p>After the last live reference to a <tt>Timer</tt> object goes away
 * <i>and</i> all outstanding tasks have completed execution, the timer's task
 * execution thread terminates gracefully (and becomes subject to garbage
 * collection).  However, this can take arbitrarily long to occur.  By
 * default, the task execution thread does not run as a <i>daemon thread</i>,
 * so it is capable of keeping an application from terminating.  If a caller
 * wants to terminate a timer's task execution thread rapidly, the caller
 * should invoke the timer's <tt>cancel</tt> method.
 * 等到最后一个指向Timer的引用离开，并且所有遗留任务都完成了，这个timer的任务执行线程就会平滑地终止（然后可以被内存回收）。
 * 然而，这一般需要花很长时间才会发生。
 * 默认情况下，任务执行线程不会已后台线程的形式运行，所以它可以方式应用的终止。
 * 如果调用者希望立即终止一个timer的任务执行线程，他可以通过调用cancel()方法来实现。
 *
 * <p>If the timer's task execution thread terminates unexpectedly, for
 * example, because its <tt>stop</tt> method is invoked, any further
 * attempt to schedule a task on the timer will result in an
 * <tt>IllegalStateException</tt>, as if the timer's <tt>cancel</tt>
 * method had been invoked.
 * 如果timer的任务执行线程异常终止了，比如因为stop()被调用了，之后所有尝试安排给timer的任务都会导致IllegalStateException，
 * 就像cancel()被调用了一样。
 * 
 * <p>This class is thread-safe: multiple threads can share a single
 * <tt>Timer</tt> object without the need for external synchronization.
 * 这个类是线程安全的，多个线程可以共享一个单独的Timer对象，并不需要额外的同步机制。
 * 
 * <p>This class does <i>not</i> offer real-time guarantees: it schedules
 * tasks using the <tt>Object.wait(long)</tt> method.
 * 这个类不提供实时保证，它通过Object.wait(long)来安排任务。
 *
 * <p>Java 5.0 introduced the {@code java.util.concurrent} package and
 * one of the concurrency utilities therein is the {@link
 * java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor
 * ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} which is a thread pool for repeatedly
 * executing tasks at a given rate or delay.  It is effectively a more
 * versatile replacement for the {@code Timer}/{@code TimerTask}
 * combination, as it allows multiple service threads, accepts various
 * time units, and doesn't require subclassing {@code TimerTask} (just
 * implement {@code Runnable}).  Configuring {@code
 * ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} with one thread makes it equivalent to
 * {@code Timer}.
 * Java 5.0 介绍了concurrent包，这里用到了其中一个并发工具类ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor，一个重复执行任务的线程池。
 * 它是Timer/TimerTask组合的一个有效的更通用的替代者，因为它允许多个服务线程，能识别多样的时间单位，并且不需要继承TimeTask，只需要实现Runnable接口即可。
 * 使用一个线程配置ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor可以使它做到和Timer一样的事。
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: This class scales to large numbers of concurrently
 * scheduled tasks (thousands should present no problem).  Internally,
 * it uses a binary heap to represent its task queue, so the cost to schedule
 * a task is O(log n), where n is the number of concurrently scheduled tasks.
 * 实现笔记：这个类可以承载大量的并发任务（几千个没问题）。
 * 在内部实现上，它使用二叉堆来存储它的任务队列，所以安排一个任务的复杂度是O(log n)，其中n是并发任务的数量。
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: All constructors start a timer thread.
 * 实现笔记：所有构造方法都会起一个timer线程。
